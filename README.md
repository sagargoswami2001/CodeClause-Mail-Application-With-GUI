# CodeClause Mail Application With GUI
- This is a GUI Based Mail Application Using Tkinter &amp; Smtplib Modules.

- **Tkinter:** Tkinter is the de facto way in Python to create Graphical User interfaces (GUIs) and is included in all standard Python Distributions. In fact, it's the only framework built into the Python standard library.

- **Smtplib:** The smtplib module defines an SMTP client session object that can be used to send mail to any internet machine with an SMTP or ESMTP listener daemon. For details of SMTP and ESMTP operation, consult RFC 821 (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and RFC 1869 (SMTP Service Extensions).

- **This is my _golden project_ of codeclause internship.**
